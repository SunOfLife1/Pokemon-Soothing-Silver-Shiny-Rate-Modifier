# Pokemon Soothing Silver - Shiny Rate Modifier

This is a basic program to change the shiny rate in Pokemon Soothing Silver. Currently it only supports v1.3.2 and does not check that the inputted file is in fact Pokemon Soothing Silver v1.3.2.

In the future I'd like to add more features, such as recognizing whether the inputted file is Pokemon Soothing Silver v1.3.2.

## How do I use this?

Do you just want the **highest shiny rate possible?**

- Unzip it
- Drag and drop your Pokemon Soothing Silver v1.3.2 file onto ShinyModifier.exe
- You're done!

Do you want to set the shiny rate to something else?
