# Pokemon Soothing Silver Shiny Rate Modifier

This is a basic program to change the shiny rate in Pokemon Soothing Silver. Currently it only supports v1.3.2 and does not check that the inputted file is in fact Pokemon Soothing Silver v1.3.2.

In the future, I'd like to make this more intuitive to use and add more features, such as recognizing whether the inputted file is Pokemon Soothing Silver v1.3.2.

## Usage

Download the latest release of this program from [Releases](https://github.com/SunOfLife1/Pokemon-Soothing-Silver-Shiny-Rate-Modifier/releases).

Drag and drop your Pokemon Soothing Silver v1.3.2 file onto ShinyModifier.exe and follow the prompts.
